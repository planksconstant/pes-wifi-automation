Approach 1

Connect to wi-fi "automate this using system calls "
Open browser and go to captive/PESU ip address
Fill in SRN and password (stored as plin text in a .txt file for now )-->(can be improved )
Click on login

Problems 
As soon as we connect to wifi the captive opens up on the desktop/os/Local machine not in a browser 
Configure OS during login-->this can also be stored in a .txt file

Features for Approach 1 
credentials --> Enters SRN and password this file also configs the OS using OS module (should chk wether credentials are stored or not add feature of changing password also)
login --> selenium automation happens here
